(*
This transformation removes uses of the `otherwise` (`ElsePr`) premise from
inductive relations.

It only supports binary relations.

1. It figures out which rules are meant by “otherwise”:

   * All previous rules
   * Excluding those that definitely can’t apply when the present rule applies
     (decided by a simple and conservative comparision of the LHS).

2. It creates an auxillary inductive unary predicate with these rules (LHS only).

3. It replaces the `ElsePr` with the negation of that rule.
